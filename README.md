# GSS Employees Management System

GSS (Gamma Security Services) is a worldwide military private security company (PMSC). For each _on_ or _off_ duty of its employees, registered in the management system, it is possible to view a personal card that presents all their data, such as:

*as person*

- generic information
- photography
- contacts

*as worker*

- Military rank
- any current assignment (e.g. mission commander in xxx)
- current status (in service/resigned/fired/retired)
- chronology of service statuses, associated with a date

Only some users of the system have the possibility to create, modify or delete employee data, while all others only have the possibility to consult them.

The system is usable via common web browsers, therefore end users haven't to install any software on their workstations. To ensure its maintainability, the system has been developed using cutting-edge technologies and the architecture has an approach open to new features.

In this GitHub repository, in addition to the source code, it is possible to find the following UML formatted documentation:

- analysis of functional requirements
- use case analysis
- component diagram
- ER diagram for defining the data model
- flowcharts for main features
- deployment diagram
- functional test document
